# To-Do List

A simple, web-based To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. The tasks are persisted using localStorage, ensuring that the list remains available even after a page refresh.

## Overview

The To-Do List application provides a straightforward interface for managing daily tasks. Users can add new tasks via an input field, toggle tasks as complete by clicking on them (which visually strikes them through), and remove tasks using a delete button. LocalStorage is used to store and retrieve the tasks, making it easy to update and maintain the list.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Input a new task and click "Add" to include it in your list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Click on a task to toggle its completed state, which changes its styling.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove a task from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved to localStorage, ensuring that your list is maintained across browser sessions.
